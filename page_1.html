				<p>Food waste has become a huge problem in every household.</p>
				
				<p>Although composting your food scraps is helpful, it's still just above a landfill! There are many ways you can improve your habits to reduce food waste, reuse older vegetables and fruits, and keep your produce fresh longer.</p>
				<p>
				This website will help inform you of all you can do.
				Look up recipes to use up older fruits or ways to make health products out of them. Search through tips on how to reduce your fotprint, keep those veggies last longer, and buy just enough for your family - so nothing gets thrown out.
				</p>
				
				<p>Give us a try! Search for a fresh food item you have that's going bad soon, and see all you can do with it.</p>

				<p>We streamlined our website to make it as easy as possible to reduce food waste.</p>
				
				<p>Simply type in what type of food you have that is going bad and search. We provide hundreds of recipes, tips, and ideas for using up this food instead of throwing it in the bin. <br><br>Unlike other websites, we give you everything - from food recipes, to health product recipes, to tips and facts. Feel free to filter your search results to see only what you want to see. </p>
